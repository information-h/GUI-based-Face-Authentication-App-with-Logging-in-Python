# 👁️‍🗨️ Face Authentication App (GUI + Logging) using Python

A simple GUI-based Face Authentication System built with Python. It uses your webcam to capture a face image, compares it against a set of stored known images, and identifies whether the person is genuine or not. All authentication attempts are logged with timestamps.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🖥️ GUI interface using `tkinter`
- 📸 Webcam-based face capture
- 🧑‍💻 Face recognition with `face_recognition` library
- ✅ Verifies if the person matches any known image
- 📝 Logs every authentication attempt (`logs.txt`)

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the following packages:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python Pillow
````

> Note: For Windows users, installing `face_recognition` may require [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Add Known Faces**
   Place clear face photos of genuine users in the `known_faces/` folder. Filenames (e.g., `john.jpg`) will be used as names.

2. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python face_auth_gui.py
   ```

3. **Click "Authenticate"**
   The webcam will capture a photo, compare it with known faces, and display the result.

4. **Check Logs**
   Every attempt is saved to `logs.txt` with timestamp and result.
